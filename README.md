# Al-jabr

Algebra: (from Arabic "al-jabr" meaning "reunion of broken parts")

This library is a core.matrix implementation for Clojure and Clojurescript,
although the focus is on Clojurescript. It provides multidimensional
arrays with cheap views and transposing.

```clj
  [thinktopic/aljabr "0.4.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

### Open Source History

This project originated as a fork of Karsten Schmidt's
[thi.ng/ndarray](https://github.com/thi-ng/ndarray) library, which is a
Clojure/Clojurescript port of Mikola Lysenko's
[ndarray core](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray) JS library.  It remains under
the same Apache license that ndarray used.
